## Steps

By the end of each step the learner should have achieved something tangible, that succeively builds up to the completed project.

### Information / learning points

If the learner is expected to read a section for information / learning, the prose should be written using standard paragraph text in markdown.

### Tasks

If the learner is expected to perform some specific task, this should be written using the task syntax, which will colour the paragraph and add a checkbox

--- task ---
The task markdown is as follows:

<html>
<pre>
&dash;&dash;&dash; task &dash;&dash;&dash;
Task instructions go here goes here.
&dash;&dash;&dash; /task &dash;&dash;&dash;
</pre>
</html>
--- /task ---
