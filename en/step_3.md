## Introduction - step_1.md

The Introduction should start as follow.

```markdown
## Introduction
A few lines describing what the user will create, beneath the level 2 header.

### What you will make
--- no-print ---
![An animation/video/embedded representation of the finished project](images/finished-project.gif)
--- /no-print ---

--- print-only ---
![A static image of the finished project](images/finished-static.png)
--- /print-only ---
```

The remaining content should be placed inside `--- collapse ---` blocks. These look like this

--- collapse ---
---
title: Title of the collapse - click me to expand
---
Here's the markdown for collapsing blocks
```markdown
--- collapse ---
---
title: Title of the collapse - click me to expand
