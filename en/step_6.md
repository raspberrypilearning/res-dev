## Challenge: Writing challenges

There should be at least one challenge in each project, and they should always occupy they're own step. The penultimate step of a project should be a challenge.

Challenges are optional, so the project can be completed even if the challenge is not attempted. They should be used to extend or improve a learner's understanding and work.

Challenges need to be designated in the `meta.yml` file:

```markdown
  - title: 'Challenge: Writing challenges'
    challenge: true
```

Don't forget the quotes as the `:` will break the build otherwise.

Titles should be of the form seen above.

```markdown
## Challenge: Writing challenges
```

Do not provide a solution to the challenge.
