## Ingredients

- Ingredients are designed to provide generic instructions within a project.

- Each ingredient is a project in it's own right.

- Ingredients should be used for general tasks such as opening a piece of software, saving a file or connecting a piece of hardware. Avoid using ingredients where generic instructions could cause confusion - such as creating a variable, where variable labels might need to be different in different projects.

- To create an ingredient, create a new project as shown in the [Quick start](./1){:target="_blank"}, but tick the box to indicate it is an ingredient.

- Ingredients should be names along the lines of 

`hardware/platform/generic-software/generic-ingredient-name`

- For example

`macos-textedit-save-a-file`

- or

`arduino-generic-connect-an-led`

- Ingredients should **not** contain any collapsable elements (hints, collapses or other ingredients).
