## Ingredients

Ingredients are designed to provide generic instructions within a project.

Each ingredient is a project in it's own right.

Ingredients should be used for general tasks such as opening a piece of software, saving a file or connecting a piece of hardware. Avoid using ingredients where generic instructions could cause confusion - such as creating a variable, where variable labels might need to be different in different projects.

To create an ingredient, create a new project as shown in the [Quick start](./1)
