## Solutions and resources

- Full code solutions should be placed in the `en/solutions` directory.

- If the output of the project is a file of some description, then this should be added to the `en/solutions` directory

- You can automatically link to the solutions directory using the following syntax

<html><pre>(http://rpf.io/p/en/project-name-get){:target="_blank"}</pre></html>

- Any online starter files should be linked to using our [rpf.io shortlink service](rpf.io/admin){:target="_blank"}.

- The shortened link should be named as shown below.

```markdown
[rpf.io/project-name-starter-on](http://rpf.io/project-name-on){:target="_blank"}.
```

- Offline starter projects should also be included, along with any assets needed (images etc), and placed in the `en/resources` directory.

- These can be automatically linked to using the following syntax

<html><pre>[rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff)</pre></html>
